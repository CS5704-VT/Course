# HW 2

This homework will provide an overview of requirements and design concepts discussed in class. Upload your responses as a .txt or .pdf file or enter your text in the [Canvas assignment](https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/145256/assignments/1384319).

## Requirements and Design Workshop

Read through the example bot and application [project ideas](../Project/IDEAS.md). Select **_two_** you might want to work on other than the Standup Bot discussed in class. Complete the following activities for both of the proposed programs.

1. Describe the problem:
    * What is the problem each problem is trying to solve?
    * Why is it a problem worth solving? Or why not?
2. Provide an example of three hypothetical non-functional requirements for this system.
3. Think of a specific task required to complete this project. Estimate the amount of effort to complete this task using function points (using the values [here](https://www.scrumpoker-online.org/en/room/601233/scrum-poker)). Briefly explain your answer.
3. Write two user stories from the perspective of _two different actors_. Provide the acceptance criteria for these stories.
4. Describe which architectural pattern you would use to structure the system. Justify your answer.
5. Discuss which design pattern family might be helpful for implementing this project. Justify your answer.

## Scavenger Hunt

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a broad research field that seeks to improve how humans interact with technology, and encompasses a variety of software design concepts such as user interfaces (UI), user experience (UX), and user-cented design (UCD). However, many software applications today still incorporate ineffective, unusable, and non-intuitive interface designs leading to frustration for users. For this task, find an example of a poorly designed software interface. If possible, provide a screenshot or picture of the design with an explanation of why you find the interface poorly designed and discuss how interface design processes (storyboarding, wireframes, or flow maps) can help the system be improved.
