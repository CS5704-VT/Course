# HW0

This homework will help you with setup for this course.


## Slack

The primary mode of communication for the course this semester will be Slack. Communication is essential in software engineering and the majority of development teams use some form of IM or messaging system. Slack is one example of these types of platforms, and we will use Slack to provide course updates, answer questions, form project groups, and other course activities. You may download the free version of the Slack desktop application at [https://slack.com/downloads/](https://slack.com/downloads/) or use it online from your preferred web browser. To sign up for the Slack workspace for this course, visit the invite link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-sla5834/shared_invite/zt-10ar21t2u-EX4CNA0cOUGX34~vg9ZjLQ). If you have problems or are unable to join via the link, contact the instructor.

__Profile__

Use the following guidelines to create your Slack profile to help the teaching staff and fellow classmates learn your name:
* Set your full name to be your first and last name. Your display name should be your first name (or name you prefer to go by).
* Upload a recent photo of yourself (professional headshot or one that meets [passport photo guidelines](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html/pptphotoreq/photocomptemplate/photocomptemplate_5297.html)) for your profile photo.

__Introductions__

To further help us all get to know each other, please introduce yourself. After your profile has been created, write a brief paragraph in the #general channel of the CS5704 [Spring 2022] Slack that contains the following information:
* Name
* Where are you from?
* Do you have any previous software engineering experience? If so, where did you work and for how long?
* What do you hope to get out of this course?

## Version Control

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system we will be using for this course. You may download the git client to your system [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Additionally, [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) are two popular cloud-based hosting services for Git. We may use either or both of these platforms throughout the course various class activities and for collaborate on your team project. Please go through the following examples to practice creating repositories on each website. To get full credit you must complete the tasks exactly as specified so make sure to read the instructions carefully.

__GitHub__

If you have not done so already, create an account on [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). Sign into your GitHub account to complete the following tasks:
1. Create a new _private_ GitHub repository named HW0-5704 with the description "Hello World" and initialized with a README file.
2. Invite the instructor (chbrown13) and TA (TBD) to be collaborators to your repository (Settings -> Manage access).
3. Using the web-based GitHub editor or cloning your repository and committing manually:
     * Edit the README file by adding your VT ID on line 4
     * Add a new file named `hello.{ext}` that prints `Hello World!` in your favorite programming language, where `{ext}` is the default file extension for source code files in your selected language.
