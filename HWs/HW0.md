This homework will help you with setup for this course.


## Slack

The primary mode of communication for the course this semester will be Slack. Communication is essential in software engineering and the majority of development teams use some form of IM or messaging system. Slack is one example of these types of platforms, and we will use Slack to provide course updates, answer questions, form project groups, and other course activities. You may download the free version of the Slack desktop application at [https://slack.com/downloads/](https://slack.com/downloads/) or use it online from your preferred web browser. To sign up for the Slack workspace for this course, visit the invite link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-sla5834/shared_invite/zt-10ar21t2u-EX4CNA0cOUGX34~vg9ZjLQ). If you have problems or are unable to join via the link, contact the instructor.

__Profile__

Use the following guidelines to create your Slack profile to help the teaching staff and fellow classmates learn your name:
* Set your full name to be your first and last name. Your display name should be your first name (or name you prefer to go by).
* Upload a recent photo of yourself (professional headshot or one that meets [passport photo guidelines](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html/pptphotoreq/photocomptemplate/photocomptemplate_5297.html)) for your profile photo.

__Introductions__

To further help us all get to know each other, please introduce yourself. After your profile has been created, write a brief paragraph in the #general channel of the CS5704 [Spring 2022] Slack that contains the following information:
* Name
* Where are you from?
* Do you have any previous software engineering experience? If so, where did you work and for how long?
* What do you hope to get out of this course?
