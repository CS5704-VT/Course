# Testing

For this milestone, we will verify that your project implementation meets the requirements use cases. Testing is vital for discovering bugs and increasing confidence that your program works correctly. This milestone will involve incorporating various testing methods by observing your repository to evaluate the validity of your project.

## Project Repository

Your code for the project must be hosted on a repository shared with the teaching staff. We will be looking for the following in order to verify the project meets your requirements.

### Unit Tests

Your repository must contain unit tests for the programming language you selected for implementation to verify the code functionality. Your README file must include instructions on how to run the unit tests for your program. All unit tests are expected to pass, however if there are failures you should explain why in the README.

### Acceptance Tests

We will perform acceptance tests to validate that your project meets the requirements use cases. In your README file, you should provide a specific [use case](REQUIREMENTS.md) (ideally one presented in your lightning talk) and provide execution steps and the expected output or behavior of the program. The teaching staff will go through each of the steps you provided and check to see if the expected output is reached.

### Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

The teaching staff will perform additional exploratory tests and code inspection to verify your program performs as expected and is able to handle edge cases or erratic inputs. Finally, your repository will also be inspected and evaluated based on other rubric criteria available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awchnlgyU6Drphzh_5OIquzfdmewNb-pLtOiBhn8sRE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awchnlgyU6Drphzh_5OIquzfdmewNb-pLtOiBhn8sRE/edit?usp=sharing)
