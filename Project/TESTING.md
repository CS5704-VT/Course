# Testing

For this milestone, we will verify that your project implementation meets the requirements use cases. Testing is vital for discovering bugs and increasing confidence that your program works correctly. This milestone will involve incorporating various testing methods by observing your repository to evaluate the validity of your project.

## Project Repository

Your code for the project must be hosted on a repository shared with the teaching staff. We will be looking for the following in order to verify the project meets your requirements.

### Unit Tests

Your repository must contain unit tests for the programming language you selected for implementation to verify the code functionality. Your README file must include instructions on how to run the unit tests for your program. All unit tests are expected to pass, however if there are failures you should explain why in the README.

### Acceptance Tests

We will perform acceptance tests to validate that your project meets the requirements use cases. In your README file, you should provide a specific [use case](REQUIREMENTS.md) (ideally one presented in your lightning talk) and provide execution steps and the expected output or behavior of the program. The teaching staff will go through each of the steps you provided and check to see if the expected output is reached.

### Exploratory Testing and Code Inspection

The teaching staff will perform additional exploratory tests and code inspection to verify your program performs as expected and is able to handle edge cases or erratic inputs. Finally, your repository will also be inspected and evaluated based on other rubric criteria available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awchnlgyU6Drphzh_5OIquzfdmewNb-pLtOiBhn8sRE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1awchnlgyU6Drphzh_5OIquzfdmewNb-pLtOiBhn8sRE/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Deliverable: _Project Repository_
* Your team repository will be used for `testing` to verify that your project meets the given requirements. This deliverable will include various [testing](TESTING.md) practices that will be evaluated and performed by the teaching staff for grading.

**Due:** Friday May 6 at 11:59pm on GitHub or GitLab


#### Deliverable: _Final Report_
* The final report must be no more than 10 pages (not including references) and follow the same ICSE formatting guidelines as the Proposal Document. The final project report must contain the following:
    * a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
    *  the _abstract_ with feedback addressed;
    *  an updated _introduction_ incorporating proposal feedback to define the problem and motivate the project solution;
    *  a _motivating example_ to provide a scenario of how your project would be used and why it is relevant to software engineers working together;
    *  a _background_ to define any key terms or concepts related to your work (if applicable);
    *  an updated _related work_ citing relevant work and the novelty of your project; 
    *  a description of the _implementation_ design decisions, processes, and testing approach **or** the _methodology_ of the expiriment you completed, (if research)
    *  a _deployment plan_ section explaining how you would `deploy` and `maintain` your project for users if you were to release it **or** _results_ to present your study findings;
    *  a _discussion_ explaining possible opportunities for future extensions and limitations of your project;  
    *  a _conclusion_ revisiting the problem statement and project work completed;
    *  and _references_ for any works that you cite.
