# Project Ideas

Below are some sample ideas for possible project topics:

### Bots
* **Standup Bot:** A software bot to automate support for standup meetings between teammates.
* **IssueBot:** Automatically perform issue or pull request maintainance tasks (such as closing stale issues, pinging owners, etc.).
* **RewardBot:** System that randomly rewards team members for performing actions (i.e. answering Stack Overflow questions, posting Slack messages, commiting code to a repo, etc.).
* **FocusBot:** Help team members to be productive while working remotely (Provide productivity aids, such as pomodoros, daily reminders, incomplete tasks, etc.).
* **ProcessBot:** System to help team members stay on track for processes related to specific software engineering processes (i.e. waterfall, XP, etc.).

### Applications
* **TODO App:** Desktop application to help developers keep track of tasks and prioritize items.
* **Example Finder:** Find and provide examples of usage for a given API method.
* **Virtual Standups:** Design an online platform to conduct virtual standups with remote teammates.
* **Team Kanban:** Collaborative Kanban board to promote team communication and collaboration.
* **Open Source:** Make a significant contribution to an existing open source software project.

### Research
