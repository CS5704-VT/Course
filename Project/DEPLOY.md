# Deployment

In the previous milestones, you proposed requirements and a design for a system to support software engineering work during COVID, and then implemented and tested the operation of a project based on the initial proposal. Here, you will demonstrate a fully deployed version of your project for the clients (aka the teaching staff).

## Deployment Plan

Your final project report must include a deployment plan explaning on how you would deploy your project to users and continue to maintain the system if given the chance. You do not need to provide excessive technical details or a definitive plan, but should describe how users would access your application and how you would continue to maintain and update the project releases. This will be used to show that you have an understandng of the software maintenance and deployment tools and practices discussed in class.

## Demo

Traditional scrum methods incorporate a Sprint Demo at the end of a sprint to show off tasks completed, new features ready to ship, etc. before preparing for the next iteration. In addition to your oral presentation in this deliverable, you will be required to perform a demo of your project to the class. The demo should include a visual representation of your project completing a use case (ideally one presented in your lightning talk or acceptance tests) from a user's perspective. Your demo may be done live in-class or pre-recorded and displayed as a video during the presentation, but it must show your project in action. The rubric for your final project presentation and demo is available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tzbtcq5ZhWqv-CYv9_DgLGddpfDyv7MFkcCigDcNdJw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tzbtcq5ZhWqv-CYv9_DgLGddpfDyv7MFkcCigDcNdJw/edit?usp=sharing)
