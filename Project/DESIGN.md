# Design

In this milestone, you will write a proposal with a high-level architecture design and design sketches for your course project. That is, your design may change from the initial proposal after beginning the implementation and bad proposals may be rejected by the professor. Make sure to spend time in coming up with a good project idea and brainstorm good designs.

## Architecture Design

You will need to provide a high-level design overview on the architecture of your project in a design section of your proposal. This section must include the following information:

* Describe the different architectural components and how they would fit together.
* Describe any constraints or guidelines that should be established in building software for your architecture.
* Describe any additional design patterns that may be relevant for your bot design.

This is the opportunity to initially think through how you might build your system to fulfill your requirements and provide a solution to the problem statement. Consider all the criteria listed here in your design proposal description.

## Design Sketches

Design sketches provide a visual overview of the look and feel of your project. This may include one of the following:

* Creating a wireframe mockup of your project user interface in action.
* Create a storyboard that illustrates a primary task that a user would complete with your project.

The design sketches may be included as part of your design proposal document or can be submitted separately.
