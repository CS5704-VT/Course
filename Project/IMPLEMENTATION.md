# Implementation

In this milestone, you will be working on implementing your use cases and applying software processes and practices discussed in class. For each use case, you must implement the basic flow described by the use case from your proposal. It is more important that you try implementing a minimal proof of concept (that covers all use cases) rather than a perfect version of your bot that only addresses one use case. The project check-in will allow you with an opportunity to reflect on your project's implementation phase and processes. 

## Process

Building software is a complex process and you will have a big team of people. The only way you will make it through this process is by careful planning and delegation of work. The teaching staff will monitor project repositories to make sure that all team members are making consistent contributions to ensure work is divided evenly and work is not being delayed until the last day of submission. You should also be using some sort of task management system or issue tracker to show progress being made, which should be shared with the teaching staff.

You may find the [SMART](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm) method a good way plan tasks to implement your project use cases and manage progress.


## Project Check-in

This milestone will involve providing a mid-semester update on your project progress. The check-in will have reflection questions on your project implementation including but not limited to:
    * What have you done so far?
    * What do you need to do next?
    * What is blocking you?
    * What software processes, methods, and tools discussed in class has your team used for the project?
    * Have your project requirements or design changed since the proposal? If so, how?
    * How confident are you that you will meet your project deliverables?
    * Are you satisfied with your team progress so far?
    * What is your testing plan for your project?
    * Provide a link/access to the project issue tracker or task management system.

> _Research-based projects should focus on data collection and analysis techniques._

#### Deliverable: _Project Check-In_
  * This will be a chance for you to provide the teaching staff with an update on your project. You will be asked to provide documentation on the `implementation` of your project and provide an overview of project progress and the software processes your team has been following.

**Due:** Friday April 8 at 11:59pm

#### Deliverable: _Report Abstract_
  * The project report abstract will be due one week before your final report. This will provide an overview of your final report by explaining the problem you addressed and your proposed solution. While you may modify the abstract in the final report after this deadline, this is a checkpoint to ensure you are making progress on your project and have at least started on your report.

**Due:** Friday April 29 at 11:59pm on Canvas
