# Project

For CS5704 this semester, you will...

## Teams

Students should form teams of 3 or 4.

## Deliverables

* __Proposal Presentation (15%)__ Due Feb 24
    * Your group will complete a _5 minute_ lightning talk on the project you plan to complete for the semester. This talk must include a problem statement and your proposed solution, and you may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish. There will also be a brief time for questions after the presentation and peer evaluations on your project proposal presentation. Your proposal oral presentation will be graded according to the following criteria: 
      1. Problem statement (what is the problem and why do you think it is interesting/important/etc?)
      2. Proposed solution (how do you plan to study or solve the problem?)
      3. Is the topic relevant to the research project description?
      4. Is the presentation clear and coherent?
      5. Is the talk 5 minutes or less?

* __Proposal Document (15%)__  Due Mar 1
  
    * Your project team must also submit a proposal document. The proposal must conform to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) formatting guidelines. See these [MS Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx), [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ) templates for more details. The report must be no more than 2-pages (not including references). Please check your report for typos and spelling or grammar errors. You will receive feedback on this proposal on whether it is a valid project and things to improve for the final report. The proposal report must contain:
      * an _abstract_ briefly describing the problem and proposed solution;
      * an _introduction_ that further explains the problem and motivates the need for the proposed solution;
      * _related work_ presenting relevant software engineering studies or tools; 
      * and _references_ with the appropriate citations. 



* __Final Report Abstract (10%)__  Due Apr 22
  
  * This will be the completed abstract for your final project report. This will provide an overview of your final report by explaining the problem you addressed and your proposed solution. While you may modify the abstract in the final report after this deadline, this is a checkpoint to ensure you are making progress on your project and have at least started on your report. For details on how to write a good abstract, check out these tips from Kent Beck [here](https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/974359988352110592?lang=fr) and [here](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html).



* __Final Report (30%)__ Due May 6
  
    * The final report must be no more than 10 pages (not including references) and follow the same ICSE formatting guidelines as the Proposal Document. The final project report must contain the following:
      *  the _abstract_;
      *  an updated _introduction_ incorporating proposal feedback to define the problem and motivate the project solution;
      *  a _motivating example_ to provide a scenario of how your project would be used and why it is relevant to software engineering;
      *  a _background_ to define any key terms or concepts related to your work (if applicable);
      *  an updated _related work_ citing relevant work and the novelty of your project; 
      *  a description of the _implementation_ explaining the design decisions that went into your project **or** the _methodology_ of the expiriment you completed, (if research)
      *  a _testing_ section to show the validity of your project and explain the testing approach **or** _results_ to present your study findings;
      *  a _discussion_ explaining possible opportunities for future work and limitations to your project;  
      *  a _conclusion_ revisiting the problem statement and proposed solution;
      *  and _references_ for any works that you cite.



* __Project Demo (20%)__ Due May 6
  * For the final oral presentation, your group must give a 10 minute talk that includes the problem statement and proposed solution, a brief overview of related work, an explanation of the proposed solution or study methodology and its rationale, tool demo or study results, and a discussion of limitations, future work, and things you learned. Your project demo may be done live or pre-recorded and displayed as a video during the presentation.



* __Retrospective (10%)__ Due May 6
  * At the conclusion of the project, you will asked to complete a brief group and individual retrospective about the team project. This will allow you to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and what you learned in addition to determining your effort towards the project and group dynamics that cannot be determined through analyzing contributions to your project code repositories.
