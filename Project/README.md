# Project

The coronavirus pandemic has had a major impact on the world we live in today. In software engineering, the pandemic has had a major impact on  To that end, your goal for the CS5704 course project this semester will be to develop a project to support software engineering work during COVID-19. For your project, you should consider the software engineering processes and utilize methods and tools for the software development life cycle phases (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment) discussed in class.

**Learning Outcomes:**
* Develop software engineering skills working on a team project
* Communicate (via demo and writing) details about a developed software application

The goal of this project is to practice processes, tools, and methods discussed throughout the class this semester and to gain practical experience working on developing a software project in a team setting.

## Guidelines

Your group can decide what type of project you would like to complete, whether it be a _development-based_ (i.e. desktop app, web app, script, bot, etc.) or _research-based_ (i.e. survey, interviews, tool evaluation, etc.) project. Try to be creative when proposing project ideas. **A challenging project with an unknown or negative outcome is more interesting than an easy project with an expected outcome.** If the project doesn't go well, explain why in your report and final presentation. If the project does go well, let's see if we can publish it! Negative results or an incomplete project will not impact your grade, given a valid reason ("_We ran out of time_" is __*not*__ a valid reason). If you have difficulty coming up with ideas for your project, check out [this list](IDEAS.md) of examples or feel free to visit my office hours to discuss.

### Requirements

The only requirement for the project is that it fits into the high-level goal, supporting software engineering work during COVID-19. Otherwise, you are given the freedom to satisfy this goal however you want as long as it meets this criteria. 

### Teams

You must work in teams of four students, unless otherwise specified. Work must be equally divided among the team. 

### Technology

You may use any programming language or tech stack you are comfortable with, as long as it is freely accessible to your teammates and the teaching staff. All projects should be maintained on a version control platform, either [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). Please add the teaching staff to your repository in order to facilitate reviews, analyze progress, and perform grading activities.

## Deliverables

You will submit your project in multiple milestones throughout the semester broadly following the software development life cycle. Specific deliverables for your project are listed below. More details can be found in the process phase links:

* __Lightning Talk (15%)__ Due Feb 24 **[_In Class_]**
    * Your group must complete an oral proposal presentation during class provding an overview of the project you wish to complete for the semester. This talk must include a problem statement, your proposed solution, how your proposed work relates to the overall project goal, and at least three sample `requirements` user stories. You may divide the presenting duties among your team however you wish, but the talk must be **_no more than 5 minutes_**. There will also be a brief time of Q&A from students after each presentation and peer evaluations on your project proposal lightning talk. The proposal oral presentation will be graded according to [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11xcUHQSFY8ux6Uu5WFnAOOUkZMLuNnf71mxmHcMmo8c/edit?usp=sharing). 

* __Proposal Document (15%)__  Due Mar 1
    * Your project team must also submit a proposal document. The proposal must conform to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) formatting guidelines (see the [MS Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx), [Latex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip), and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official#.WOuOk2e1taQ) templates). The proposal should be no more than 2-pages (excluding references). Please check your document for typos and spelling or grammar errors. The proposal must contain:
      * a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
      * an _abstract_ briefly describing the problem and proposed solution;
      * an _introduction_ that further explains the problem and motivates the need for the proposed solution;
      * _related work_ presenting relevant software engineering studies or tools; 
      * a section on the high-level `design` of the proposed work (how different parts of the system work together);
      * and _references_ to any appropriate citations. 

> You will receive feedback from the teaching staff on the document and presentation for your proposal to approve of your course project for the semester.

* __Project Check-In (5%)__ Due Apr 8
  * This will be a chance for you to provide the teaching staff with an update on your project. You will be asked to provide documentation on the Requirements and Design of the project and provide an overview of project progress and the software processes your team has been following. Some potential questions include but are not limited to:
      * What have you done so far?
      * What do you need to do next?
      * What is blocking you?
      * Has your project changed since the original proposal? If so, how?
      * What software processes, methods, and tools has your team used for the project `implementation`?
      * How confident are you that you will meet your project deliverables?  
      * Are you satisfied with your team progress so far? 
      * What is your `testing` plan for your project?

* __Report Abstract (5%)__  Due Apr 22
  * The project report abstract will be due one week before your final report. This will provide an overview of your final report by explaining the problem you addressed and your proposed solution. While you may modify the abstract in the final report after this deadline, this is a checkpoint to ensure you are making progress on your project and have at least started on your report. For details on how to write a good abstract, check out these tips from Kent Beck [here](https://twitter.com/kentbeck/status/974359988352110592?lang=fr) and [here](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/research/beckOOPSLA.html).

* __Final Report (30%)__ Due May 6
    * The final report must be no more than 10 pages (not including references) and follow the same ICSE formatting guidelines as the Proposal Document. The final project report must contain the following:
      * a relevant _title_ and all group members listed as _authors_;
      *  the _abstract_ with feedback addressed;
      *  an updated _introduction_ incorporating proposal feedback to define the problem and motivate the project solution;
      *  a _motivating example_ to provide a scenario of how your project would be used and why it is relevant to software engineering;
      *  a _background_ to define any key terms or concepts related to your work (if applicable);
      *  an updated _related work_ citing relevant work and the novelty of your project; 
      *  a description of the _implementation_ explaining the design decisions that went into your project **or** the _methodology_ of the expiriment you completed, (if research)
      *  a _testing_ section to show the validity of your project and explain the testing approach **or** _results_ to present your study findings;
      *  a _discussion_ explaining possible opportunities for future work and limitations to your project;  
      *  a _conclusion_ revisiting the problem statement and proposed solution;
      *  and _references_ for any works that you cite.


* __Project Demo (20%)__ Due May 6 **[_In Class_]**
  * For the final oral presentation, your group must give a 10 minute talk that includes the problem statement and proposed solution, a brief overview of related work, an explanation of the proposed solution or study methodology and its rationale, tool demo or study results, and a discussion of limitations, future work, and things you learned. Your demo may be done live or pre-recorded and displayed as a video during the presentation.

* __Retrospective (5%)__ Due May 6
  * At the conclusion of the project, you will asked to complete a brief group and individual retrospective about the team project. This will allow you to reflect on what went well, what didn't go well, and what you learned in addition to determining your contributions and the effort of your teammates towards the project. The overall grade will be impacted by reported group dynamics that cannot be determined through analyzing contributions to your repository.


## Late Policy
* No late work will be accepted unless there are extreme circumstances approved by the instructor. All deliverables must be turned in by 11:59pm on the given due date unless otherwise specified.
